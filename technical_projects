  Multiverse Projects:

For my first project I worked with RZ and Andres on a warehouse inventory. 
I primarily worked on the html and css aspects of the website utilizing the 
overflow property to create side scrollling menus and an animated, interactive logo.
Andres and RZ also taught me how to utilize axios which was a technology I wasnâ€™t familiar with.

My next project Jeff and I worked together on a television show review app.
For this app we utilized technologies such as javascript,sequalize and jest.

    Personal projects:

Prior to my time at multiverse I attended the Flatiron bootcamp where I learned 
fullstack web developement. During this time I gained experience learining and 
applying Ruby,Ruby on Rails,Javascript and React.
We had four phases in this bootcamp that started with building out a backend, 
learning the associated technologies along the way and ending the phase with 
an assesment and group project.

Our final project was a solo effort where we took eeerything we learned and came 
up with a project of our choice. For this project I decided to make a flash fighting game
using all of the technologies mentioned above in addition to Jquery,Sass and photoshop. The 
Characters were originlly created by myself but I later added more presentable sprites I
found after some digging.
