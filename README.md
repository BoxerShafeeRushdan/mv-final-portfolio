###Multiverse Final Portfolio

This repo is a collection of some of my learning contribution during my 2022-2023 apprenticeship at Box sponsored by Multiverse.

    Overview

During my time at Box as part of the SWAT team, I deilvered value by completing hundreds of tickets referencing bugs on numerous aspects of the application. I also joined the on call rotation within a few months of my apprenticeship making me at times solely responsible for off hours request. In addition to that, I also gained leadership experience onboarding a fellow multiverse apprentice that was recently added to the team. During this onboarding process I helped improve our teams onboarding documentation prompted by questions from the new apprentice. Finally, I was given development opportunities I am currently stil working on such as script updates and interteam projects.

Because of the sensitive nature of Box's codebases and the restrictions placed on us being Boxers, I will avoid using any tickets and rely just on explanation.


    Durable Skills

The durable skills contains a README file that outlines my contributions to Box during my apprenticeship. I have outlined courses I have taken during my onboarding process as well as describe lessons learned from my Box mentors.


    Technical Projects

My technical projects section contains two folders, one for my multiverse projects, and one for me personal projects. Feel free to look through to see all of the different frameworks and languages I have been practicing in the last year!

I'd like to thank Multiverse for their continued support throughout my apprenticeship process. They have truly paved the way into a new career for me and I will be forever grateful.

Of course, I would like to thank Box. for employing me and giving me such a great learning environment to hone my skills. I can already see a durastic change in my skills and value to the team and it is all because of their great team organization and learning community.

A special thanks to my Coach at multiverse, Brad, for his tireless support of me and the other apprentices in my cohort. I hope you continue to help other engineers start their careers!
