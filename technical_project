  Multiverse Projects:

For my first project I worked with RZ and Andres on a warehouse inventory. 
I primarily worked on the html and css aspects of the website utilizing the 
overflow property to create side scrollling menus and an animated, interactive logo.
Andres and RZ also taught me how to utilize axios which was a technology I wasnâ€™t familiar with.

My next project Jeff and I worked together on a television show review app.
For this app we utilized technologies such as javascript,sequalize and jest.
